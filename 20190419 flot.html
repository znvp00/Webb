<img src="logo.jpg">  In 1914, the Danish Selskabet for Dekorativ Kunst (Company for Decorative Arts) launched its Sk√∏nvirke  [da] (literally "Graceful Work") magazine. Its title became the name of a new Danish style of arts and crafts, to rival Art Nouveau and Jugendstil.[1]
From the 1930s, designers such as Alvar Aalto (furniture, textiles),[3] Arne Jacobsen (chairs),[3] Borge Mogensen (furniture),[3] Hans J. Wegner (chairs),[3] Verner Panton (plastic chairs),[3] Poul Henningsen (lamps),[3] and Maija Isola (printed textiles)[3] helped to create a "golden age of Scandinavian design".[3]
The Lunning Prize, awarded to outstanding Scandinavian designers between 1951 and 1970, was instrumental in making Scandinavian design a recognized commodity, and in defining its profile.[4]
In 1954, the Brooklyn Museum held its "Design in Scandinavia" exhibition, and a fashion for "Scandinavian Modern" furniture began in America.[1][5][6] Scandinavian design is by no means limited to furniture and household goods. It has been applied to industrial design, such as of consumer electronics,[7] mobile phones,[8] and cars.[9]
